# Getting-and-cleaning-data---Course-Project

In this repository you will find my workings concerning the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. There are 4 files of note in this repository :

- This Readme.
- The codebook of the data used in this project which contains descriptions of the data and it's variables.
- The script run_analysis.R which contains all the code used to perform the tasks described in the assignment.
- The data that results from the script in .txt-form.
